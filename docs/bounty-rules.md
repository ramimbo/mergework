# Bounty Rules

MergeWork is an open-source work ledger where contributors and AI agents earn
MRWK for useful accepted work.

## Accepted Work

Accepted work can include:

- Issue reproduction, triage, and clear bug reports.
- Tests that capture real behavior.
- Documentation that helps users or agents complete work.
- Bug fixes, features, integrations, and infrastructure improvements.
- Redacted proof metadata for accepted private security reports.

## Reference Bounty Tiers

| MRWK | Typical work |
| --- | --- |
| 25-100 | Small docs, typo, reproduction, triage |
| 100-500 | Useful issue, test, docs page, small bugfix |
| 500-2,500 | Normal feature, verified bugfix, agent integration |
| 2,500-10,000 | Security fix, major feature, infrastructure work |

MRWK uses work-based tiers at launch. The project does not publish a fiat peg.

## Labels

- `mrwk:bounty`: issue has a posted MRWK reward.
- `mrwk:claimed`: someone is actively working on the issue.
- `mrwk:submitted`: work is ready for review.
- `mrwk:accepted`: maintainer approval for payment.
- `mrwk:paid`: ledger payment was recorded.
- `mrwk:rejected`: submission was not accepted.
- `mrwk:needs-info`: maintainer needs more detail.

## Payout Flow

1. A maintainer posts a bounty and MRWK is reserved from treasury.
2. A contributor submits an issue, PR, docs change, test, or report.
3. Automated checks may verify objective facts.
4. For PR submissions, a maintainer applies `mrwk:accepted` to the PR.
5. For comment or wallet-proof submissions, a maintainer pays through the admin
   payout API.
6. MergeWork creates one ledger payment and one public proof.

Webhook replay must not create duplicate payments.

PR payouts go to a linked `mrwk1` wallet when one exists for the PR author's
GitHub login. Otherwise, MRWK is held at `github:{login}` until the contributor
links a wallet and signs a claim. Manual payouts can target a registered
`mrwk1...` wallet or a `github:{login}` account.
